In this porject we worked on using SVM to predict the rating of a recipe based on its ingredients.

Code directory contains the python script to extract features from recipe files. It generates a test and train file for SVM based on ingredients of recipes. 
It also generates test and train file in different categories of recipes based on metadata files.

OutputNLTK folder contains test and train files for each recipe categoty for SVM Multiclass and the result of running SVM Multiclass.
